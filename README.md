# Algorithms Lab Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises of the Algorithms Lab.
Minimizing the asymptotic runtime of the algorithms is the primary objective.
Code quality only served the purpose to fix bugs and make changes quickly
(e.g., in case the problem statement wasn't fully understood correctly).
